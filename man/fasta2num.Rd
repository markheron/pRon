\usage{
fasta2num(fastas, oligo_length, method = "lookupTable")
}
\arguments{
\item{fastas}{(DNAStringSet) of same length fasta sequences that should be converted}

\item{oligo_length}{(numeric) length of the oligo-nucleotides to use.}
}
\value{
matrix of numeric representation of the fastas
}
\description{
Transforms a DNAStringSet with equal length objects into a matrix of numeric representation of the oligo-nucleotides.
Any oligo-nucleotide with a letter differing from A,C,G,T is represented as **NA**
}
